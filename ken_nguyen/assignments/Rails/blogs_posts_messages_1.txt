#blogs_posts_messages_1 

#Start a new project and create the models for the ERD below. This is an application that allows people to create blogs, write posts for each blog, and leave messages for a post.

	rails new blogs_posts_messages_1
	cd blogs_posts_messages_1
	sublime .
	#in gemfile: gem 'hirb'
	bundle install

#Create the migration files as well as the models for the application above.

	rails g model Blog name:string description:text
	rails g model Post blog:references title:string content:text
	rails g model Message post:references author:string message:text

	rake db:migrate

	#in blog.rb file:
		class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
			has_many :posts, dependent: :destroy
			has_many :messages, through: :posts
		end

	#in post.rb file:
		class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
		  belongs_to :blog
		  has_many :messages, dependent: :destroy
		end

	#in message.rb file:
		class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
		  belongs_to :post
		end



#Implement the following validations:

	#require the presence of name and description for the blog.

		validates :name, :description, presence: true

	#require the presence of title and content for the posts, require the title to be at least 7 characters long.

		 validates :title, :content, presence: true
		 validates :title, length: { minimum: 7 }


	#require author and message for the messages. Require the message to be at least 15 characters long.

		  validates :author, :message, presence: true
		  validates :message, length: { minimum: 15 }



#Using the console:

	#create 5 new blogs.

		for i in 1..5
			Blog.create(name:"blog#{i}", description:"blog_desc#{i}")
		end

	#create several posts for each blog.

		for i in 1..5
			for j in 1..3
				Post.create(blog:Blog.find(i), title:"title--#{i}--#{j}", content:"content--#{i}--#{j}")
			end
		end


	#create several messages for the first post.

		for i in 1..3
			Message.create(post:Post.first,author:"author #{i}",message:"123456789101112131415 -- #{i}")
		end


	#know how to retrieve all posts for the first blog.

		Blog.first.posts
		Blog.first.messages


	#know how to retrieve all posts for the last blog (sorted by title in the DESC order).

		Blog.last.posts.order(title: :desc)

	#know how to update the first post's title.

		Post.first.update(title:"This is a new title")

	#know how to delete the third post (have the model automatically delete all messages associated with the third post when you delete the third post).

		Post.find(3).destroy
		Post.order(:id).limit(1).offset(2).destroy

		#in the post.rb model, include this line
			has_many :messages, dependent: :destroy

	#know how to retrieve all blogs.

		Blog.all

	#know how to retrieve all blogs whose id is less than 5.

		Blog.where(id: 1...5)

	#think of other potential information you may need for this application and get comfortable being able to pull information using the console.

		okay
