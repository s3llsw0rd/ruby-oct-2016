#friends assignment

rails new friends

rails g model User first_name:string last_name:string

rails g model Friendship user:references friend:references

##on the user model
	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
		has_many :friendships
		has_many :friends, through: :friendships
	end

##on the friendship model
	class Friendship < ActiveRecord::Base
	  belongs_to :user
	  belongs_to :friend, class_name: "User"  ## <-- this line is important, the :friend object would not exist otherwise

	  	###here we created an object :friend by declaring that it is from the class "User", which the friendship table will reference to. The User table will have many :friends (through :friendships). Friendship.user_id = User.id , Friendship.friend_id = User.id (because it is of the class "User")
	end

rake db:migrate

rails c

User.create(first_name:"Ken", last_name:"Nguyen")
User.create(first_name:"House", last_name:"Of Cards")
User.create(first_name:"Kermit", last_name:"Frog")
User.create(first_name:"Alien", last_name:"Ware")

Friendship.create(user:User.first, friend:User.second)
 #user 1 is now friends with user 2
 #but this does not make user 2 friends with user 1 -- does not reciprocates the realtionship 

User.first.friends --> works!

question 3:

userfriends = User.first.friends
userfriendsid = [User.first.id]
userfriends.each { |friend| userfriendsid << friend.id }
User.where.not(id: userfriendsid)
